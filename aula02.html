    <h1>Javan Rhinos</h1>

    <p style="padding: 20px 400px ;"> "The Javan rhinoceros (Rhinoceros sondaicus), Javan rhino, Sunda rhinoceros or
        lesser one-horned rhinoceros is a critically endangered member of the genus Rhinoceros, of the rhinoceros
        family, Rhinocerotidae, and one of the five remaining extant rhinoceros species across South Asia and Africa.
        The Javan rhinoceros is one of the smallest rhinoceros species, along with the Sumatran, or "hairy", rhinoceros.
        They are superficially similar to Indian rhinos, as they have plate-like, "armored" protective skin folds, but
        are slightly smaller, at just 3.1–3.2 m (10–10 ft) long and 1.4–1.7 m (4 ft 7 in – 5 ft 7 in) tall, on average.
        The heaviest specimens weigh around 2,300 kg (5,100 lb), similar to a black rhinoceros.[4] However, unlike the
        long and potentially lethal horns of the black or white rhinoceroses of Africa, the Javan species' single,
        somewhat blunted horn (only present on males) is usually shorter than 25 cm (9.8 in)." </p>
